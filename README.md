A simple WebSocket server to create a public chat room. 
This project is created for learning purposes, getting to know what is WebSocket, how it is being used in an application. You can freely use this repository.
## Tech stacks

- Run `npm install`
- Start server `npm start`

- Enjoy!

You can check out my example on Heroku here: [MassiveQ](https://massiveq.herokuapp.com/)

## Under research and development:
- Private chat room: connect 2 random persons into a room. From my research, WebRTC will be a good way to implement this functionality, it could help us to build more than just a message chat (video call). However, I still have so much to learn! Go with me.
